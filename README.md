Design Web site existing and extinct species of flora and fauna to depict complex ecosystems from various parts of the world. The virtual zoo could be displayed in schools, museums, and Ministries without using much physical space. The zoo could also hold educational sessions about the environment within the virtual space using document teachers from around the world. The students can easily enhance their knowledge through web site and this web site can be represented as software in future .
